I'm a Nigerian 
In Nigeria we eat plantain to garnish dishes. This garnishing takes the dish from 0 - 100 in about 12 minutes, 
because thats how long it takes to fry plantain.
I like plantain chips in my jollof when I can't get my hands on fried plantain :(
It is a nightmare when you are stuck at home without any plantain products.
